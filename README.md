# Summary
My first attempt at making a code converter that changed Python code into Java code.
Perhaps one of my most ambitious early projects and I eventually quit working it. This
project was were I first learned about seriously working on writing tests. It was also
a decently abstract project because there are many things that need to happen in order for a
working conversion to happen. I had more successful attempts in the future that could actually
somewhat convert code, but I still have not made a 1:1 Python -> Java code because that is
impossible because the library and API calls do not always have a 1:1 conversion.
